In case of integrals that have unbounded intervals or have discontinuities in its domain of integration then further extensions of the usual interpretation of the Riemann Integral is necessary. \n",

The Gaussian integral, $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{x^{2}}dx$, unfortunately is one of those integrals that cannot be interpreted using the usual Riemann Integral.\n",
